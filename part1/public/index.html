            The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also
            called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by
            hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and
            before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the
            ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

            Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary
            widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail),
            powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared
            to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many
            roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding
            disabled people, and assisting police and the military.

            Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements
            of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They mark their
            territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia,
            dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and
            communicate with humans. As such, the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs'
            influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

            The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is
            the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. Developed countries make up
            approximately 20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing
            countries, mainly in the form of feral and community dogs.

            Cladogram and divergence of the gray wolf (including the domestic dog) among its closest extant relatives[4]
            Dogs are domesticated members of the family Canidae. They are classified as a subspecies of Canis lupus,
            along with wolves and dingoes.[5][6] Dogs were domesticated from wolves over 14,000 years ago by
            hunter-gatherers, before the development of agriculture.[7][8] The remains of the Bonn–Oberkassel dog,
            buried alongside humans between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, are the earliest to be conclusively identified
            as a domesticated dog.[9][7] Genetic studies show that dogs likely diverged from wolves between 27,000 and
            40,000 years ago.[10] The dingo and the related New Guinea singing dog resulted from the geographic
            isolation and feralization of dogs in Oceania over 8,000 years ago.[11][12]

            Dogs, wolves, and dingoes have sometimes been classified as separate species.[6] In 1758, the Swedish
            botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus assigned the genus name Canis (which is the Latin word for "dog")[13]
            to the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal in his book, Systema Naturae. He classified the
            domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus.[2] Linnaeus
            considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata in
            Latin term), which is not found in any other canid.[14] In the 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World,
            mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed the wolf as a wild subspecies of Canis lupus and proposed two
            additional subspecies: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus in 1758, and dingo, named by Meyer in 1793.
            Wozencraft included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior synonym) for the dingo.
            This classification was informed by a 1999 mitochondrial DNA study.[3]

            The classification of dingoes is disputed and a political issue in Australia. Classifying dingoes as wild
            dogs simplifies reducing or controlling dingo populations that threaten livestock. Treating dingoes as a
            separate species allows conservation programs to protect the dingo population.[15] Dingo classification
            affects wildlife management policies, legislation, and societal attitudes.[16] In 2019, a workshop hosted by
            the IUCN/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea
            singing dog to be feral Canis familiaris. Therefore, it did not assess them for the IUCN Red List of
            threatened species.[17]
