            The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also
            called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by
            hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and
            before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the
            ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

            Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary
            widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail),
            powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared
            to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many
            roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding
            disabled people, and assisting police and the military.

            Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements
            of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They mark their
            territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia,
            dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and
            communicate with humans. As such, the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs'
            influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

            The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is
            the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. Developed countries make up
            approximately 20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing
            countries, mainly in the form of feral and community dogs.
